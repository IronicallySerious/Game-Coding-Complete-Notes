# Game-Coding-Complete-Notes
Collection of my notes while reading Game Coding Complete 4th Edition by Mike McShaffry and David Graham

## Disclaimer
I am not maintaining this anymore. This book is massive and making notes at every point is not really the best way to go about learning the stuff mentioned in this book. If you are a reader, I encourage you to start implementing the stuff that is talked about in the book yourself without looking at the implementations. Just take the ideas and go about it yourself.

We are using this book pretty seriously in https://github.com/SDSLabs/Rootex
